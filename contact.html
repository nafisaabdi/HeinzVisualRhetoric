              Leo Bunnet Heinz Artifacts: Brief Visual Rhetoric Analysis
            </h2>
            <p class="tm-mb-6">
              The Leo Burnett advertising agency has worked with Heinz, as their Global Advertising Agency, for years.
              The Leo Burnett advertising agency has been creating ads for Heinz since 1998. We will be taking a specific
              look at three separate ad campaigns created by Leo Burnett. These ads were selected because they diverge from the visual
              imagery and narrative we’re used to seeing in Heinz ads.

              Typically, Heinz capitalizes off of their signature bold “Heinz Red. As well as the greenery that usually supports their
              claim that Heinz is “grown <strong>not</strong> made”. Instead these ads have a novel approach to advertising the product. </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
           	  For this Ad campaign Leo Burnet decided to display food made out of cardboard. The first one is a cardboard
              cut-out of an egg followed by a cutout of a steak and lastly fries.The message being conveyed by this ad comes
              across clearly. Without Heinz Ketchup, your food will taste like cardboard. They are able to make a logical appeal
              by setting this scene. The ad is minimalistic while leaving an impactful message. The only text used in the image is
              the bold “without” that works to bring your attention to the only colorful object. The Ketchup bottle showcases their
              well-known brand which is where ethos comes into play. When it comes to pathos I believe this can be seen in the gap that it
              takes at the audience. The consumer is being told that without ketchup they don’t have any hope of making good tasting food.
              All these elements combine to create a quality Heinz ad that efficiently gets across their message.

              This ad campaign was created for Heinz’s Hot Ketchup. At first glance, you might be taken aback or confused by the imagery.
              Upon further inspection, we can see that we are viewing the food and “Hot Ketchup” through glass. The first image is a fish
              tank and the second is a water vase. Our eyes are drawn to the warped food in the distance and we can make out the shape of a ketchup bottle.
              The message being conveyed by the images is a clear and concise. The Hot Ketchup is so hot you won’t even be composed enough to grab a glass of water.
              This Ad is very impactful and does a good job of conveying information without the use text. However, I’m not conveyed the visual rhetoric is enough
              to stand on its own. Without context, the audience won’t be able to get to the conclusion that the reason they’re drinking water from a fish bowl or
              vase is due to the heat of the product. We aren’t able to get a clear enough view of the Ketchup label through the warped image. For this reason,
              I would consider this to be a drawback as the audience might not be able to reach the necessary conclusion.

              This ad is similar to the previous ad was created to promote the Hot Ketchup Heinz Product.
              They also unfortunately fell a bit short when it came to this ad. The narrative is similar to the
              first ad we looked at. However, unlike the first one isn’t as well executed. They use actual frozen
              foods and are attempting to get the message across that your food won’t be appetizing without the product.
              It falls short though because they have conflated heat with spiciness. This has the undesired effect of
              giving the audience the impression that the food will end up like this with the use of the product.
